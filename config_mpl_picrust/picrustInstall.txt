Hi Kassi,

Thanks for your detailed message. I'm not aware of what the 'module' package does that you are trying to install via conda. In lieu of that, I have tried to install PICRUSt on my Mac using conda. Following are specifications of the my conda, Python and Mac and the individual steps with which I used to successfully install PICRUSt on Mac:

conda 4.1.6 with Python 2.7.12 for Mac OS X El Capitan Version 10.11.4. 

I assume you have sudo permissions, load up a new terminal window and do the following steps:

# Create a new environment call picrust_env
# Install numpy and wget pacakges
conda create -n picrust_env numpy==1.5.1 wget
source activate picrust_env
# Install pyqi, cogent and biom separately, since it's causing problem
pip install pyqi cogent==1.5.3 biom-format==1.3.1 

PICRUSt (1.0.0):
# curl not retreiving the whole file for some reason
python -c 'import wget; wget.download("https://github.com/picrust/picrust/releases/download/1.0.0/picrust-1.0.0.tar.gz")'
tar -xzvf picrust-1.0.0.tar.gz
mv picrust-1.0.0.tar.gz picrust-1.0.0
python -c 'import wget; wget.download("ftp://ftp.microbio.me/pub/picrust-references/picrust-1.0.0/16S_13_5_precalculated.tab.gz")'
# This step will take some time
python -c 'import wget; wget.download("ftp://ftp.microbio.me/pub/picrust-references/picrust-1.0.0/ko_13_5_precalculated.tab.gz")'
mkdir picrust-1.0.0/picrust/data
mv ko_13_5_precalculated.tab.gz picrust-1.0.0/picrust/data
mv 16S_13_5_precalculated.tab.gz picrust-1.0.0/picrust/data
cd picrust-1.0.0/
python setup.py install

Hope this helps and works.

Lastly, PICRUSt and QIIME should have their own separate virtual environments. You cannot have both QIIME and PICRUSt in same virtual environment to work.

I know it's a bit of a pain switching between two environments but at the moment, this is the solution I see. Maybe PICRUSt developers can better comment on when they plan to update their BIOM version. Thanks a lot.

Cheers,
Ali
